Our group is being tasked with assisting, designing, and deploying new WAN
infrastructure for Ontario Tech and itâ€™s affiliates. In this scenario, we are implementing networks
on three different campuses under Ontario Tech, north Oshawa, Toronto, and Ottawa. This
network incorporates concepts learned in the Advanced Networking 2 course, these included
the use of protocols such as DMVPN, MPLS, and PBR, along with concepts including route
redistribution and route filtering
